___
In the course of the 2D CNC project, following achievements were made today:

`1.` The frame structure of the machine was modified.
- The frame structure used to be an open, beam-less structure. A beam was added in the modified design today.
`2.` The movement mechanism of the work-bed was upgraded with a better design from the original idea.
- The original idea was to use a conveyor belt system to move the work-table back and forth and the conveyor belt was to be connected to the stepper motor.
- The upgraded idea is to use a linear thread mechanism to convert the rotational motion from the stepper motor into linear motion, and the motion is to be transferred into the bed to allow the movement of the bed as per requirement.

In redesigning and modifying the overall structure, following errors are encountered:

`1.` Due to the unbalanced height of the beam with the work table, there is a tumbling movement in the work table.
`2.` Due to the difference in the diameter of the thread system, there occurs a topple movement which causes the bed to have a slight rotation along the horizontal.

Using the linear thread system can cause the following errors in the future:

`1.` There is a chance to have a backlash error and a slight error in the pitch distance of the thread.

___
2<sup>nd</sup> day of the project 2D CNC machine:

Measurements of linear thread distance and pitch was measured.

<h3>Measurements</h3>
___
1<sup>st</sup> Measurement:

L=7
P=4
EE=2
___
2<sup>nd</sup> Measurement:

L=7-8 -> 8
P=4
EE=2-3 -> 3
___
3<sup>rd</sup> Measurement:

L=7-8 -> 7
P=4
EE=2-3 -> 3
___
Above measurements for the error calculations were recorded as per date 2080/02/30 to minimize the errors occurring in the 2D CNC machine.
___
Date:2080/02/31

___
3<sup>rd</sup> day of the project 2D CNC machine:

As the backlash error and the pitch were solved, the work table was found to be in collision with the stepper motor during the movement of the table back and forth.
The error occurring was solved by narrowing the size of the bed so that the bed would slide above the stepper motor without any obstruction.
___
Date:2080/03/02-06

___
Few days were spent in searching for different locally available requirements necessary for the construction of the frame of the CNC machine.
A material was found and bought to the workspace.
The material was reduced to the size of the requirement.
___
Project works were halted for a few days due to critical conditions of several project members as well as due to the unavailability of the necessary equipment on hand.
