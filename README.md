## Abstraction

Here lies the overall abstraction of the whole project and other required notes, references and citations:

> CNC stands for Computer Numeric Control. It is the machining that uses subractive manufacturing process to make custom designed parts. It uses computerized machine tools and the process involves programming the machine tools to direct them at a material unit until the material forms the input designed parts. CNC machines are electrical-mechanical devices that control and manipulate tools and materials through computer programming. The computer program controls and manipulates such tools through high-precision around a 5 or 3.5 on the axes. CNC machines commonly combine tools into common units or cells from which the machine can draw. Basic machines move in one or two axes, while advanced machines move laterally in the x, y-axis, longitudinally in the z-axis, and often rotationally about one or more axes. The most basic function of any CNC machine is **automatic, precise, and consistent motion control**.

> The project was completed with a team of three, second year and first year students from different faculties coming together to work on a common level, those were two from electronics second year and one from mechanical second year, with one mentor from third year electronics and one more from third year mechanical. The project was observed by a few new comers as well, as a source of learning in their early days. The project was given a purpose by the hard work of these members and mentors and the help from [Robotics Club, IOE Purwanchal Campus, Dharan.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1zxnQARuhcLXbbhD6)
